# Shuttle Finder
## Description
Basically, I got tired of having to do grid-based search of a schedule for Northwestern University's intercampus shuttle in 2023.  So, I decided to set out to make a querying tool.

## How to Use
Right now, it's not very user-friendly.  To use it, you'd need to clone the repository to your computer, open up an IDE, and manually alter the code before running it.  You also have to make sure your queries exactly match the proper format.  This is something I will be fixing ASAP.


## Things To Do:
- Create input-cleaning necessary to interact with query.py in a more intuitive, less rigid manner
- Create terminal interface to launch the query
- Add browser querying?
- Add texting integration?
- Add geolocation? 
    - probably not, don't want to deal with the privacy concerns or anything
    - also kind of overkill, as querying through text should be more than enough
- integration with University website/TransLoc app?
